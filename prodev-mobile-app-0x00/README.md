# First Mobile App with Expo Router

## Steps I Followed
1. Went to my repo: `cd prodev-mobile-setup`
2. Created a folder: `prodev-mobile-app-0x00`
3. Inside it, created a new Expo app:  

(chose Router TypeScript template).
4. Opened `app-example/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
5. Changed text from "Welcome!" to "** First App Created**".
6. Ran the app with `npx expo start` and saw it on my phone.

## Reset Project
- Ran `npm run reset-project`.
- It deleted `node_modules`, cleared cache, and reinstalled everything.
- Observation: The project was like “brand new” again, ready to run.
